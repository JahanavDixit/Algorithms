//Basic Euclidean Algorithm for GCD 
// The algorithm is based on the below facts. 

// If we subtract a smaller number from a larger (we reduce a larger number), GCD doesnâ€™t change. So if we keep subtracting // repeatedly the larger of two, we end up with GCD.
// Now instead of subtraction, if we divide the smaller number, the algorithm stops when we find remainder 0.
